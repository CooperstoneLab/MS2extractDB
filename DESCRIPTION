Description: Raw MS/MS data of a set of authentic phenolics standards, 
  including phenolic acids, flavonoids, dihydrochalcones, and carbohydrates. 
  MS/MS data was collected using an Agilent QTOF 6545 and a 6546, in negative
  and positive polarities, and 20 and 40 eV (CE).  
  The raw MS/MS files will be used jointly with the MS2extract package
  to create in-house MS/MS libraries.
