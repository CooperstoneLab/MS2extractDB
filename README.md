<!-- badges: start -->
<!-- badges: end -->

The goal of MS2extractDB is to stored the MS/MS data of a set of
authentic small molecules standards, including, phenolic acids,
flavonoids, dihydrochalcones, carbohydrates. Standards were collected
using an Agilent QTOF 6545 and 6546, in negative and positive
polarities, and 20 and 60 eV (CE). Standards that were collected using
the 6546 QTOF also contains MS/MS at 60 and 80 eV (CE). The raw MS/MS
files will be used jointly with the MS2extract package to create
in-house MS/MS libaries.
